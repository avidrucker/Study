; Let's say that we want to, in LCC Assembly, read, write, add, and subtract 
; 32 bit numbers. The benefits to this could include things such as 
; representation of 32 floating point, as well as larger numbers. This could
; also scale up to 64 bit numbers, and so on.

; PROGRAM 1b: print a 32 digit number
; This version of the program uses a different mechanism
; to detect when it is on the last loop.
; The method is uses is to count up the number of 0 results
; from the division of the first and second halves. When the
; combined addition of 0 results equals 2, we know that we
; are on the last loop.
